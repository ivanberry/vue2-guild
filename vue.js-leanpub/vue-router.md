# Vue Router
Routing, in general, refers to determining how you application responds to a client request. A web browser request wouldn't directed to your application without some form of routing. Router helps a web server to fetch an appropriate and exact information for the user. It's like a station master at railway station, who informs the train operator when to change tracks.

The way of swapping views we just studied, paves the way for routing. The official router for Vue.js is called **vue-router**. It's deeply integrated with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications a breeze. This plugin is relatively easy to understand, install, and use.

The main feature are:

- Nested route/view mapping
- Modular, component-based router configuration
- Route params, query, wildcards
- View transition effects powered by Vue.js transition system
- Fine-grained navigation control
- Links with automatic active CSS classes
- HTML5 history mode or hash mode, with auto-fallback in IE9
- Restore scroll position when going back in histroy mode
